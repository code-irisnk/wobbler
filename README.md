# wobbler
DEPRECATED IN FAVOUR OF
[scrumblr](https://github.com/nyaambxr/scrumblr)
which does the same thing as wobbler but with tumblr

anyways, wobbler was a simple, 
easy to use, 
free and open source,
Last.fm to Twitter integration.

with terminal based OAuth!

## Setup

[get a last.fm api account!](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)

[get a twitter api account!](https://dev.twitter.com/apps)

rename ```example_keys.json``` to ```keys.json```

add your keys (get twitter access keys by running wobbler.py once)

and then you're ready to run wobbler endlessly :]
